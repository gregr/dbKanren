;;; Persistent databases ;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; Limitations:
;; - A single database will not scale well to enormous numbers of relations.
;; - This implementation will not scale well to high frequency database updates.
;; - A single database should not be used by multiple host processes running concurrently.
;;   Initializing the same database from concurrent processes may lead to data corruption.
;; - Multiple threads of a single process can concurrently read from the same database, but it is
;;   not safe to read concurrently with an update to the same database.
;; - It is not safe to perform concurrent updates on the same database.
;; - While it should be possible to recover from typical process failure and interruption, sudden
;;   host system failure and interruption may corrupt data.

;; A database is a persistent collection of extensional relations, and is represented as a
;; filesystem directory managed by an instance of checkpointing storage.

;; An extensional relation is a uniquely named, finite set of ordered tuples.  Each tuple in the set
;; contains the same number of fields.  For each field, every tuple assigns the same name and type
;; to that field.  The list of field types is called the relation's type.  The field names are
;; called the relation's attributes, and each name must be unique within the relation.

;; For efficient querying, a relation can be indexed on one or more permutations of a subset of its
;; attributes.  An index provides an efficient way to filter and enumerate a subset of the
;; relation's tuples.  To filter the tuples, constraints are applied to a subset of the relation's
;; attributes, eliminating tuples that do not satisfy the constraints.  The index's attribute
;; permutation is the order in which attributes will be constrained.  This order of constraining
;; attributes is efficient due to the representation of the index, which is the result of sorting
;; the relation's tuples lexicographically according to the attribute permutation.

;; Databases and relations can be modified:
;; - New relations can be added to, and existing relations can be removed from, a database.
;; - Relations and their attributes can be renamed.
;; - Indexes can be added to, or removed from, a relation.
;; - Tuples can be inserted into, or deleted from, a relation.
;; Database and relation modifications always occur in the context of an atomic database update, and
;; multiple such modifications can be performed as part of the same update.  This means that
;; multiple relations can be modified simultaneously, each being modified in one or more ways,
;; during such update.  Updates are atomic in the sense that they never partially succeed: either
;; all specified modifications are performed, or none are performed.
