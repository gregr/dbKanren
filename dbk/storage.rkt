;; This is a simple implementation of checkpointing storage.  It includes block storage for large
;; data, and key-value storage for small data and metadata.

;; Limitations:
;; - The default key-value store will not scale well to enormous amounts of data and/or enormous
;;   numbers of blocks (because these require tracking metadata).
;; - The default key-value store will not scale well to high frequency checkpoints.
;; - A single storage location should not be used by multiple host processes running concurrently.
;;   Initializing the same storage location from concurrent processes may lead to data corruption.
;; - Multiple threads of a single process can read concurrently from a single storage location,
;;   but it is not safe to read concurrently with writes or checkpoint commits to that location.
;; - It is not safe to perform concurrent writes or checkpoint commits to a single storage location.
;; - While it should be possible to recover from typical process failure and interruption, sudden
;;   host system failure and interruption may corrupt data.

;; Two forms of data can be stored:
;; - Description
;;   - "description" is a key-value map.
;;   - Keys and values can be any s-expression.
;;   - Keys can be added and removed.  A key's value can be updated.
;; - Block
;;   - Blocks are uninterpreted files of data.
;;   - Blocks are referenced by names.  A name can be any s-expression.  Each name maps to at most
;;     one block.  Multiple names can refer to the same block.
;;   - When a new block is created, it's data can be written and modified freely until the next
;;     checkpoint.  Once the checkpoint is committed, blocks cannot be updated.
;;   - Block data is only expected to be read after the checkpoint that creates them.
;;   - Blocks are not explicitly deleted.  A block is garbage collected once there are no longer
;;     any names referring to it after a checkpoint.

;; Storage system initialization and checkpoint commits will perform garbage collection of unused
;; blocks and old state descriptions.  By default, each collection will move garbage to a new
;; subdirectory under "trash", to make it possible to manually recover from mistakes.

;; A storage location is a self-contained directory with the following structure:
;;   block/
;;     filename-for-block-id
;;     ...
;;   metadata/
;;     current.scm
;;     [next.scm]
;;   trash/
;;     trash-uid/
;;       any-file ...
;;     ...
;;   [trash-pending/
;;     any-file ...]

;; Do not store other files anywhere within this directory structure.

;; The current state of the system is stored in metadata/current.scm.  While committing a
;; checkpoint, the next state temporarily lives in metadata/next.scm.  These states are Racket
;; s-expressions with the following shape:
;;   (hash
;;     'format-version  datum
;;     'checkpoint-time pretty-timestamp
;;     'data            (hash
;;                        'description (hash ,@{any-key any-value} ...)
;;                        'block       (hash ,@{any-name block-id} ...)))
